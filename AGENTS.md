# AGENTS.md — okay-wordle

Wordle in a page on okay-ui (screens as data) and okay-faces (the Laminar face). Read `specs/wordle.md` first: the
code follows it, a change of design is a change of the spec first.

- The data model is effects (`Secret`, `Results`, okay-ui's `Ui`); every implementation is a handler; the browser's
  main is one line. Tests swap handlers: no mocks.
- Builds from released libraries only (okay-ui 0.1.0 and what it brings, from their GitHub Pages mavens).
- How the board looks is the skin's (`InTheBrowser.skin`): the program only marks shapes.
- Before a commit: `sbt appJVM/test`; after a change to a page, `sbt appJS/web` and `scripts/e2e.scala`.
- Scripts are scala-cli, never Python. Scala 3.3, lines at most 120 wide, English in code and docs.
- Commits: plain messages, no attribution trailers.
